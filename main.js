// console.log("meow");

// Pseudo code

// 1. Create html element will hold all slot hours
// 2. Add css classes for the element so it has blocks/lines for every hour slot from 9.00 until 17.00h ( 8 divs/blocks)
// 3. Take the current time in format Friday, January 20nd and place it within element id="currentDay". format ("dddd MMMM Qo")
// In order to color code each time block based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed is to create a loop which is checking every block if it is in past hour, present hour or future hours. If equals to one of those 3 types of hours (past, present, future) I must add the relevant class to change the color of the corresponding block.
// Create event listener for every event being added to the blocks
// Store the event in Local storage so when the page reloads, the events are still rendering on the page in the same location
